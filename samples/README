     This directory contains sample proofs done with the aid of LP.  Associated
with each proof are the following files:
     *.lp	    a file of commands used to perform the proof
     *.lplog	    a log of the proof (created by "make")
     *.lpscr        an LP-annotated script of commands for performing the proof
                    (also created by "make")
Other files in this directory are as follows.
     Makefile       helps create *.lplog, .lpscr, Statistics
     Statistics     statistics about the proofs
     arbiter.doc    description of arbiter circuit


arbiterG	Preservation of invariant by arbiter circuit (global proof)
arbiterL	Preservation of invariant by arbiter circuit (local proof)
cpu		Correctness of pipelined cpu implementation
fib		Equivalence of two definitions of Fibonacci numbers
list1     	Associativity of "append"; rev(rev(x)) == x
list2		Ditto, but proved by consistency rather than by induction
mutex		Mutual exclusion for arbiter circuit (cf. arbiterG, arbiterL)
ring1		Correctness of ring oscillator (direct proof)
ring2		Correctness of ring oscillator (proof by contradiction)
set		Sample theorems about finite sets
sorting		Correctness of insertion sort
sum		The sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2
