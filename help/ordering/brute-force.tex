LP's \def{brute-force} ordering procedures give users complete control over the
direction in which formulas are oriented into 
\llink{rewrite-rule}{rewrite rules}, but provide no guarantees about 
termination.

\head{2}{The \fq{left-to-right} ordering}

This ordering method causes LP to orient equations into rewrite rules from left
to right, provided the results are valid rewrite rules.  Equations that cannot
be oriented from left to right are left unoriented.

\head{2}{The \fq{either-way} ordering}

This ordering method causes LP to orient equations into rewrite rules from left
to right, provided the results are valid rewrite rules.  If an equation cannot
be oriented from left to right, but can be from right to left, the method
causes it to be oriented in that direction; otherwise it is left unoriented.

\head{2}{The \fq{manual} ordering}

When the \setlink{automatic-registry} setting is \fq{off}, this ordering method
causes LP to \dlink{interactive}{interact} with the user to select an
orientation for each equation.  When the setting is \fq{on}, this ordering
method does not orient any formulas into rewrite rules.
