\head{2}{Usage}

The working directory for LP is the directory in which it creates files in
response to the \dflink{../commands/freeze_thaw}{freeze}, 
\dflink{log}{set log}, \dflink{script}{set script}, and \cflink{write} 
commands.  A period (\fq{.}) in the setting of \dflink{lp-path}{lp-path} refers
to this directory.
\p
The default working directory is the directory in which LP was invoked.
The \fq{set directory} command changes the working directory in all proof
contexts.
