An \def{inconsistency} is a \dlink{formula}{formula} that is logically false.
\p
LP automatically recognizes the formula \fq{x ~= t}, where \fq{t} is a term not
involving the variable \fq{x}, as inconsistent.  Thus, LP rules out empty
sorts.  It also recognizes the formulas \fq{false} and \fq{b = t}, where \fq{t}
is a term not involving the boolean variable \fq{b}, as inconsistent.  Thus,
the boolean sort contains two distinct values.
\p
If an inconsistency arises during a proof by
\dlink{../proof/by-contradiction}{contradiction}, that proof succeeds.  If it 
arises during a proof by \dlink{../proof/by-cases}{cases}, the current case is
deemed impossible.
