\ref{proof-of-deduction-rule}

LP permits users to prove \llink{deduction-rule}{deduction rules} as well as
\clink{assert} them.  It automatically generates a single subgoal when asked to
initiate a proof of a deduction rule.  The subgoal involves showing that the
conjunction of the hypotheses of the deduction rule implies the conjunction of
its conclusions.
\p
For example, the command
\begin{verbatim}
prove when \A x:Elem (x \in s:Set <=> x \in t:Set) yield s = t
\end{verbatim}
causes LP to generate a single subgoal which involves proving the formula
\begin{verbatim}
\A x:Elem (x \in s:Set <=> x \in t:Set) => s = t
\end{verbatim}
\p
LP also generates a single subgoal when asked to initiate a proof of a
\llink{partitioned-by}{partitioned-by}.  This subgoal is the one associated
with the translation of the partitioned-by into a deduction rule.
