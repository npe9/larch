Proofs of conjunctions can be slow because the operator \f{/\} is
\llink{operator-theory}{associative and commutative}, and 
\olink{match}{matching} modulo such operators is inherently slow.
The command \fq{prove t1 /\ ... /\ tn by /\} provides a way to reduce this
expense by directing LP to prove each of the conjuncts as a separate subgoal.
\p
The command \fq{resume by /\} directs LP to resume the proof of the current
conjecture using this method.  It is applicable only when the current
conjecture has been reduced to a conjunction.
\p
Users should beware that employing this method too early in a proof can result
in lengthening the proof considerably, for example, when the same sequence of
commands or the same lemma is needed to prove more than one conjunct.
