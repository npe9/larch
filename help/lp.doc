   NAME
     lp - The Larch Prover (Release 3.1)

   SYNOPSIS
     lp [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e...  ]


   DESCRIPTION

     The Larch Prover (LP) is an interactive proof assistant for multisorted
     first-order logic.  It can be used to axiomatize theories and to provide
     assistance in proving theorems.

   OPTIONS

     -d _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y-_n_a_m_e
          Specifies a location other than /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_L_P for LP's help
          files and library of axiomatizations.

     -t   Sets testing mode, in which errors do not terminate execution of
          command files.

   USAGE

     LP is a command-driven system, which either prompts its user for input
     or executes commands from files.  By convention, the names of command
     files end with the suffix ._l_p.  The shell command
          lp _f_i_l_e_1 ... _f_i_l_e_N
     causes LP to execute the commands in the files _f_i_l_e_1._l_p, _f_i_l_e_N._l_p, and
     then to prompt the user for input when those file are exhausted.

     Information about how to use LP can be obtained by typing the LP command
     ``help _t_o_p_i_c''.  Type ``help LP'' for a general introduction to LP, or
     ``help ?'' for a list of all _t_o_p_i_c_s on which help is available.  The
     same information is also available in hypertext format, with
     /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_l_i_b/_L_P/_h_e_l_p/_o_v_e_r_v_i_e_w._h_t_m_l as the home page.

     In most cases when LP expects input, you can type a question mark (?) to
     obtain a summary of the legal responses.
