\head{2}{Usage} 
The \fq{push-settings} command saves the current values of all
\dlink{set}{local settings} by pushing them on a stack.  The \fq{pop-settings} 
command restores the values of these settings by popping them off the stack.
\p
The \cflink{write} command places the \fq{push-settings} and \fq{pop-settings}
commands in \fq{.lp} files so that named axioms can be loaded from these files
without affecting the current \setlink{name-prefix}, \setlink{activity}, and
\setlink{immunity} settings.
