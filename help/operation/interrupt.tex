Often one wants to interrupt an \cflink{execute}, \cflink{order}, 
\cflink{critical-pairs}, or \cflink{complete} command (e.g., to change the 
\dlink{../commands/register}{registry}, to \clink{display} the system, to alter
the \setlink{trace-level}, or to \dflink{../commands/freeze_thaw}{freeze} the
system).  This can be done by typing \fq{^G} (hold down the control key and
type \fq{g}), which will return the user to the LP command level (it may take
several seconds for this to happen).  The \cflink{complete} and \cflink{order}
commands can be issued again to resume their execution.
